# 📊 Periodix

**Periodix** is a web application that renders an interactive **Periodix table of elements**, offering both visual engagement and scientific insights.

## 🧠 Description

Periodix is one of the developer’s early JavaScript projects, built using **Vanilla JavaScript** to sharpen coding skills and express a passion for physics and chemistry. The application is fully functional and serves as both a learning tool and a base for future improvements.

This project demonstrates:

* Practical use of JavaScript for dynamic DOM manipulation
* Responsive HTML/CSS design
* A data-driven interface that enhances user interaction

> 💡 Although complete, the developer acknowledges room for enhancements such as search functionality, improved UI design, and mobile optimization.
